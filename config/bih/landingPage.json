To ensure the integrity and reliability of your research, we strongly recommend exercising due diligence in identifying and handling duplicate images in any datasets you select. This is particularly crucial when preparing data for use in training AI models, as duplicates in training data can introduce biases, overfitting, and other issues that may compromise the performance and generalizability of your models."
